// Coding Challenge #1

// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
// and height in meter).

// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
// m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76


let Mark_mass = 78;
let John_mass = 95;
let Mark_height = 1.69;
let John_height = 1.95;
let Mark_Bmi = Mark_mass / (Mark_height * Mark_height)
let John_Bmi = John_mass / (John_height * John_height)
console.log(Mark_Bmi)
console.log(John_Bmi)
let markHigherBMI = Mark_Bmi > John_Bmi;
console.log(markHigherBMI)
